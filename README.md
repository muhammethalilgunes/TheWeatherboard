#### Description:
This is a weather application built using Processing, which allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city they input. 

Key features of the app include:
- Display of temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, switchable with buttons.
- Weather conditions like clouds, rain, snow, and more, along with custom icons.
- Information about humidity and UV index.
- Ability to refresh weather data by clicking a "Refresh" button.
- Input text box for city names.

The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It also provides UV index details and adjusts the temperature display based on user preference for Celsius or Fahrenheit. The interface is designed with easy-to-navigate buttons and a responsive text input field for city searches.
